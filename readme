HOW TO USE - THIS WILL SCRAPE ALL LEAD NAME, EMAIL, LINKEDIN, etc from each contact)

In apollo.js, at the beginning you'll see this:

async function run() {
    const baseUrl = '';
    const csvUrl = 'apollo.csv';
    const email = '';
    const password = '';

INPUT - baseURL (the url of the list you want scraped, if you don't have a list go to apollo.io and make one and paste the URL between 'https://apollo.io/LINKLINKLINK'.
INPUT email (the business email attached with your account)
INPUT password (The password associated with your account)

# to scrape more than 1K leads, add this at the start of the script

const puppeteer = require('puppeteer');
const fs = require('fs');

// Define the convertKToNumber function to handle 'K' notation
function convertKToNumber(input) {
    let number;
    if (typeof input === 'string' && input.includes('K')) {
        number = parseFloat(input.replace('K', '')) * 1000;
    } else {
        number = parseInt(input, 10);
    }
    return isNaN(number) ? 0 : number;
}
